Simple application created on mysql database.
To save yours time i used springboot and free online database,
so everything is ready to test ;)
To fast test i prefer to use REST Client.
Project created in intelij.
All of configuration informations are in application.properties and configuration folder.
Secure password to Intelij database viewier = 12345
For this project i use jackson dependency for json and xml.
In real project i prefer JAXB to xml.


Best regards :)
